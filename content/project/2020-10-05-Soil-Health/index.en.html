<p><b> Goal: Modeling Soil Environment for Different Agroecosystems </b></p>
<p>For more specific objectives:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Developing Soil Health Index (Which can be used to define Health of a particular farm land and can be used to determine the vital capacity/yield efficiency of the land for long-term cropping system)</p>
<ul>
<li>We published one article in this objective: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989420305680">Soil Health Gap</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Determine the core ecological community (microorganisms). (Though there are a lot of studies on how microbial/biological communities changes under different environment and management practices; but there is still less number of studies on core community which can be used as an indicators for specific soil health condition.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As a first objective:</p>
<p>we are looking for collaborators from all over the world who are actively involved/studying long-term agroecology. The concept is to compile and study the published data to come up with core hypothesis which can correlate ecological data, agronomic management practices to soil health status.</p>
