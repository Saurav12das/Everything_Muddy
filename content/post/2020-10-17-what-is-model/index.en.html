<p>So, when we start discussion or thinking about model, some complex equation or some mathematical derivation comes to your mind, but for now lets start this things from a simple definition</p>
<div id="what-is-model" class="section level1">
<h1>1. What is “Model” ?</h1>
<h4>
The most common thing about model is “A model is a representation for a particular thing with particular purpose”
</h4>
<p>we have been exposed/experienced or used different kinds of models from our childhood. Lets say, a toy, a toy is a representation of particular animal/tree or humans, but its not the real or true animal, its a representation of a particular animal.</p>
<p>A model may be physical or just an idea, but it always stands for something else: <strong>its a representation</strong>.</p>
<p>When you create a model you always start with a <strong>purpose</strong> in your mind. Like the purpose of toys is to entertain kids.</p>
<p>Model always miss out few things, get some more thing, many things goes wrong.So, for model there is no need for a question like <strong>is the model true ?</strong>, if truth is to be the whole truth the answer will be no. The model is only representation and the question of interest should <strong>is the model useful?</strong> A good model is close to the thing its trying to represent.</p>

George Box told all models are wrong but some are useful </b></i>

<p>Statistical models generally revolve around data. There are three main uses/purpose of statistical models.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Description</strong> - It can be used to describe the values and relationship among the data. For eg. Relationship between the high gasoline price and sell of car.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction</strong> - It can be used to predict something based on observable traits, qualities or attributes. For eg. You have a patients blood sugar level, blood pressure level, and other laboratory measurements, now you want to predict or proper word here will be diagnose the patient illness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consequences/Making decisions</strong> - Now you are active participant in the model making the decisions based on your model predictions. For eg. To what extent will paying teachers more increase student performance ?</p></li>
</ol>

Okay, now before heading directly towards doing modeling, lets discuss some basic terms like variables, samples etc.
