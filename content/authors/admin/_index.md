I am a post doctoral research associate in [Maharjan's Soil Science Lab](https://agronomy.unl.edu/maharjan-research-people) at the Panhandle Research & Extension Center, University of Nebraska, Nebraska, USA. I am interested in lot of things in Science but mostly involved in research including Soil Health, Geomicrobiology (especially functional microbial ecology study), Plant-Microbe Interactions, Antibiotic Resistance and Data-Science. On a lazy day you may find me on lake side doing fishing and having beer.
